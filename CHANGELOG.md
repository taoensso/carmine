# `v3.3.0-RC1` (2023-07-18)

> 📦 [Available on Clojars](https://clojars.org/com.taoensso/carmine/versions/3.3.0-RC1)

This is a **major feature release** which includes **possible breaking changes** for users of Carmine's message queue.

The main objective is to introduce a rewrite of Carmine's message queue that *significantly* improves **queue performance and observability**.

## If you use Carmine's message queue:

  - Please see the 1804ef97 commit message for important details.
  - Please **test this release** carefully before deploying to production, and once deployed **monitor for any unexpected behaviour**.

My sincere apologies for the possible breaks. My hope is that:

  - Few users will actually be affected by these breaks.
  - If affected, migration should be simple.
  - Ultimately the changes will be positive - and something that all queue users can benefit from.
