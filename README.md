 * **Fully documented**, API with full support for the latest Redis versions
 * **Great performance**
 * Industrial strength **connection pooling**
 * Composable, **first-class command functions**
 * Flexible, high-performance **binary-safe serialization** using [Nippy]
 * Full support for **Lua scripting**, **Pub/Sub**, etc.
 * Full support for custom **reply parsing**
 * **Command helpers** (`atomic`, `lua`, `sort*`, etc.)
 * **Ring session-store**
 * Simple, high-performance **message queue** (v2+, Redis 2.6+)
 * Simple, high-performance **distributed lock** (v2+, Redis 2.6+)
 * Pluggable **compression** and **encryption** support (v2+)

Your link here?          | **PR's welcome!**

## Getting started

Add the necessary dependency to your project:

```clojure
Leiningen: [com.taoensso/carmine "3.1.0"] ; or
deps.edn:   com.taoensso/carmine {:mvn/version "3.1.0"}
```

And setup your namespace imports:

```clojure
(ns my-app
  (:require [taoensso.carmine :as car :refer (wcar)]))
```

### Connections

You'll usually want to define a single connection pool, and one connection spec for each of your Redis servers.

```clojure
(def server1-conn {:pool {<opts>} :spec {<opts>}}) ; See `wcar` docstring for opts
(defmacro wcar* [& body] `(car/wcar server1-conn ~@body))
```

A simple example spec with default pool and one server using redistogo.com would be:

```clojure
(def server1-conn {:pool {} :spec {:uri "redis://redistogo:pass@panga.redistogo.com:9475/"}})
```

### Basic commands

Executing commands is easy:

```clojure
(wcar* (car/ping)) ; => "PONG" (1 command -> 1 reply)

(wcar*
  (car/ping)
  (car/set "foo" "bar")
  (car/get "foo")) ; => ["PONG" "OK" "bar"] (3 commands -> 3 replies)
```

Note that executing multiple Redis commands in a single `wcar` request uses efficient Redis [pipelining] under the hood, and returns a pipeline reply (vector) for easy destructuring, etc.

If the number of commands you'll be calling might vary, it's possible to request that Carmine _always_ return a destructurable pipeline-style reply:

```clojure
(wcar* :as-pipeline (car/ping)) ; => ["PONG"] ; Note the pipeline-style reply
```

If the server responds with an error, an exception is thrown:

```clojure
(wcar* (car/spop "foo"))
=> Exception ERR Operation against a key holding the wrong kind of value
```

But what if we're pipelining?

```clojure
(wcar* (car/set  "foo" "bar")
       (car/spop "foo")
       (car/get  "foo"))
=> ["OK" #<Exception ERR Operation against ...> "bar"]
```

### Serialization

The only value type known to Redis internally is the [byte string]. But Carmine uses [Nippy] under the hood and understands all of Clojure's [rich datatypes], letting you use them with Redis painlessly:

```clojure
(wcar* (car/set "clj-key" {:bigint (bigint 31415926535897932384626433832795)
                           :vec    (vec (range 5))
                           :set    #{true false :a :b :c :d}
                           :bytes  (byte-array 5)
                           ;; ...
                           })
       (car/get "clj-key"))
=> ["OK" {:bigint 31415926535897932384626433832795N
          :vec    [0 1 2 3 4]
          :set    #{true false :a :c :b :d}
          :bytes  #<byte [] [B@4d66ea88>}]
```

Types are handled as follows:

Clojure type             | Redis type
------------------------ | --------------------------
Strings                  | Redis strings
Keywords                 | Redis strings (v2+)
Simple numbers           | Redis strings
Everything else          | Auto de/serialized with [Nippy]

You can force automatic de/serialization for an argument of any type by wrapping it with `car/serialize`.

### Documentation and command coverage

Like [labs-redis-clojure], Carmine uses the [official Redis command reference] to generate its own command API. Which means that not only is Carmine's command coverage complete with the Redis version at the time of build, but it's also **fully documented**:

```clojure
(use 'clojure.repl)
(doc car/sort)
=> "SORT key [BY pattern] [LIMIT offset count] [GET pattern [GET pattern ...]] [ASC|DESC] [ALPHA] [STORE destination]

Sort the elements in a list, set or sorted set.

Available since: 1.0.0.

Time complexity: O(N+M*log(M)) where N is the number of elements in the list or set to sort, and M the number of returned elements. When the elements are not sorted, complexity is currently O(N) as there is a copy step that will be avoided in next releases."
```

### Lua

Redis 2.6 introduced a remarkably powerful feature: server-side Lua scripting! As an example, let's write our own version of the `set` command:

```clojure
(defn my-set
  [key value]
  (car/lua "return redis.call('set', _:my-key, 'lua '.. _:my-val)"
                  {:my-key key}   ; Named key variables and their values
                  {:my-val value} ; Named non-key variables and their values
                  ))

(wcar* (my-set "foo" "bar")
       (car/get "foo"))
=> ["OK" "lua bar"]
```

Script primitives are also provided: `eval`, `eval-sha`, `eval*`, `eval-sha*`. See the [Lua scripting docs] for more info.

### Helpers

The `lua` command above is a good example of a Carmine *helper*.

Carmine will never surprise you by interfering with the standard Redis command API. But there are times when it might want to offer you a helping hand (if you want it). Compare:

```clojure
(wcar* (car/zunionstore "dest-key" 3 "zset1" "zset2" "zset3" "WEIGHTS" 2 3 5))
(wcar* (car/zunionstore* "dest-key" ["zset1" "zset2" "zset3"] "WEIGHTS" 2 3 5))
```

Both of these calls are equivalent but the latter counted the keys for us. `zunionstore*` is another helper: a slightly more convenient version of a standard command, suffixed with a `*` to indicate that it's non-standard.

Helpers currently include: `atomic`, `eval*`, `evalsha*`, `info*`, `lua`, `sort*`, `zinterstore*`, and `zunionstore*`. See their docstrings for more info.

### Commands are (just) functions

In Carmine, Redis commands are *real functions*. Which means you can *use* them like real functions:

```clojure
(wcar* (doall (repeatedly 5 car/ping)))
=> ["PONG" "PONG" "PONG" "PONG" "PONG"]

(let [first-names ["Salvatore"  "Rich"]
      surnames    ["Sanfilippo" "Hickey"]]
  (wcar* (mapv #(car/set %1 %2) first-names surnames)
         (mapv car/get first-names)))
=> ["OK" "OK" "Sanfilippo" "Hickey"]

(wcar* (mapv #(car/set (str "key-" %) (rand-int 10)) (range 3))
       (mapv #(car/get (str "key-" %)) (range 3)))
=> ["OK" "OK" "OK" "OK" "0" "6" "6" "2"]
```

And since real functions can compose, so can Carmine's. By nesting `wcar` calls, you can fully control how composition and pipelining interact:

```clojure
(let [hash-key "awesome-people"]
  (wcar* (car/hmset hash-key "Rich" "Hickey" "Salvatore" "Sanfilippo")
         (mapv (partial car/hget hash-key)
               ;; Execute with own connection & pipeline then return result
               ;; for composition:
               (wcar* (car/hkeys hash-key)))))
=> ["OK" "Sanfilippo" "Hickey"]
```

### Listeners & Pub/Sub

Carmine has a flexible **Listener** API to support persistent-connection features like [monitoring] and Redis's fantastic [Publish/Subscribe] facility:

```clojure
(def listener
  (car/with-new-pubsub-listener (:spec server1-conn)
    {"foobar" (fn f1 [msg] (println "Channel match: " msg))
     "foo*"   (fn f2 [msg] (println "Pattern match: " msg))}
   (car/subscribe  "foobar" "foobaz")
   (car/psubscribe "foo*")))
```

Note the map of message handlers. `f1` will trigger when a message is published to channel `foobar`. `f2` will trigger when a message is published to `foobar`, `foobaz`, `foo Abraham Lincoln`, etc.

Publish messages:

```clojure
(wcar* (car/publish "foobar" "Hello to foobar!"))
```

Which will trigger:

```clojure
(f1 '("message" "foobar" "Hello to foobar!"))
;; AND ALSO
(f2 '("pmessage" "foo*" "foobar" "Hello to foobar!"))
```

You can adjust subscriptions and/or handlers:

```clojure
(with-open-listener listener
  (car/unsubscribe) ; Unsubscribe from every channel (leave patterns alone)
  (car/psubscribe "an-extra-channel"))

(swap! (:state listener) assoc "*extra*" (fn [x] (println "EXTRA: " x)))
```

**Remember to close the listener** when you're done with it:

```clojure
(car/close-listener listener)
```

Note that subscriptions are *connection-local*: you can have three different listeners each listening for different messages, using different handlers. This is great stuff.

### Reply parsing

Want a little more control over how server replies are parsed? You have all the control you need:

```clojure
(wcar* (car/ping)
       (car/with-parser clojure.string/lower-case (car/ping) (car/ping))
       (car/ping))
=> ["PONG" "pong" "pong" "PONG"]
```

### Binary data

Carmine's serializer has no problem handling arbitrary byte[] data. But the serializer involves overhead that may not always be desireable. So for maximum flexibility Carmine gives you automatic, *zero-overhead* read and write facilities for raw binary data:

```clojure
(wcar* (car/set "bin-key" (byte-array 50))
       (car/get "bin-key"))
=> ["OK" #<byte[] [B@7c3ab3b4>]
```

### Message queue

Redis makes a great [message queue server]:

```clojure
(:require [taoensso.carmine.message-queue :as car-mq]) ; Add to `ns` macro

(def my-worker
  (car-mq/worker {:pool {<opts>} :spec {<opts>}} "my-queue"
   {:handler (fn [{:keys [message attempt]}]
               (println "Received" message)
               {:status :success})}))

(wcar* (car-mq/enqueue "my-queue" "my message!"))
%> Received my message!

(car-mq/stop my-worker)
```

Guarantees:
 * Messages are persistent (durable) as per Redis config
 * Each message will be handled once and only once
 * Handling is fault-tolerant: a message cannot be lost due to handler crash
 * Message de-duplication can be requested on an ad hoc (per message) basis. In these cases, the same message cannot ever be entered into the queue more than once simultaneously or within a (per message) specifiable post-handling backoff period.

See the relevant [API] docs for details.

### Distributed locks

```clojure
(:require [taoensso.carmine.locks :as locks]) ; Add to `ns` macro

(locks/with-lock
  {:pool {<opts>} :spec {<opts>}} ; Connection details
  "my-lock" ; Lock name/identifier
  1000 ; Time to hold lock
  500  ; Time to wait (block) for lock acquisition
  (println "This was printed under lock!"))
```

Again: simple, distributed, fault-tolerant, and _fast_.

See the relevant [API] docs for details.

## Tundra (beta)

Redis is a beautifully designed datastore that makes some explicit engineering tradeoffs. Probably the most important: your data _must_ fit in memory. Tundra helps relax this limitation: only your **hot** data need fit in memory. How does it work?

 1. Use Tundra's `dirty` command **any time you modify/create evictable keys**
 2. Use `worker` to create a threaded worker that'll **automatically replicate dirty keys to your secondary datastore**
 3. When a dirty key hasn't been used in a specified TTL, it will be **automatically evicted from Redis** (eviction is optional if you just want to use Tundra as a backup/just-in-case mechanism)
 4. Use `ensure-ks` **any time you want to use evictable keys** - this'll extend their TTL or fetch them from your datastore as necessary

That's it: two Redis commands, and a worker! Tundra uses Redis' own dump/restore mechanism for replication, and Carmine's own message queue to coordinate the replication worker.

Tundra can be _very_ easily extended to **any K/V-capable datastore**. Implementations are provided out-the-box for: **Disk**, **Amazon S3** and **DynamoDB**.

```clojure
(:require [taoensso.carmine.tundra :as tundra :refer (ensure-ks dirty)]
          [taoensso.carmine.tundra.s3]) ; Add to ns

(def my-tundra-store
  (tundra/tundra-store
    ;; A datastore that implements the necessary (easily-extendable) protocol:
    (taoensso.carmine.tundra.s3/s3-datastore {:access-key "" :secret-key ""}
      "my-bucket/my-folder")))

;; Now we have access to the Tundra API:
(comment
 (worker    my-tundra-store {} {}) ; Create a replication worker
 (dirty     my-tundra-store "foo:bar1" "foo:bar2" ...) ; Queue for replication
 (ensure-ks my-tundra-store "foo:bar1" "foo:bar2" ...) ; Fetch from replica when necessary
)
```

Note that this API makes it convenient to use several different datastores simultaneously (perhaps for different purposes with different latency requirements).

See the relevant [API] docs for details.

## Performance

Redis is probably most famous for being [fast]. Carmine hold up its end and usu. performs w/in ~10% of the official C `redis-benchmark` utility despite offering features like command composition, reply parsing, etc.
