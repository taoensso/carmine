* Next
** Re-eval choice to switch away from KeyedObjectPool
** Review arch needs for Cluster, esp. re: conns

** Add SSB stats to pooled manager (borrow time, etc.)?
** Add SSB stats to Sentinel?
** Common & core util to parse-?marked-ba -> [<kind> <payload>]
** Some way to implement a parser over >1 replies?
E.g. fetch two sets, and parser to merge -> single reply

* Later
** New Pub/Sub API? (note RESP2 vs RESP3 differences)
Pub/Sub + Sentinel integration
psubscribe* to Sentinel server
check for `switch-master` channel name
"switch-master" <master-name> <old-ip> <old-port> <new-ip> <new-port>

** Implement Cluster (enough user demand?)
** Use Telemere (shell API?)

* Polish
** Print methods, toString content, etc.
** Check all errors: eids, messages, data, cbids
** Check all dynamic bindings and sys-vals, ensure accessible
** Document `*default-conn-opts*`,     incl. cbs
** Document `*default-sentinel-opts*`, incl. cbs
** Complete (esp. high-level / integration) tests
** Review all config, docstring, privacy, etc.
** Grep for TODOs

* Refactor commands
** Add modules support
** Support custom (e.g. newer) commands.json or edn
** Refactor helpers API, etc.
** Modern Tundra?
** Further MQ improvements?

* Release
** v4 upgrade/migration plan
** v4 wiki with changes, migration, new features, examples, etc.
** First public alpha

* CHANGELOG
